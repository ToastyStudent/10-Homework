# 10-Homework-SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description
This project was built from code provided via Northwestern University's Full-stack Development Coding Bootcamp's TAs, with me rewriting code in order to ensure I understand how to properly build the app were I to attempt to do so again under less time constraints than those I am currently under.

Specifically, I used Object Oriented Programming and Node.js in conjunction with the Inquirer and Jest node packages to construct and test application that generates a logo, in one of three shapes, with any number of colors, and colored text that can be up to three letters long.

Sample SVGs I created using my own application can be found [in the examples folder](./examples/).

# Installation and Usage
One must first clone this Github respoitory, run npm i to install the various node_modules that allow the application to run, and then run the command "node index.js"

After doing so, to use the app, one must answer the prompts which show up sequentially in the terminal in order to generate a logo in the form of a .svg file that one can render in their browser.

# Credits
This entire project was built using code provided by Northwestern University's Full-stack Development Coding Bootcamp TAs from the following repository:

With their express permission, I used the code provided as a template which I then modified, primarily through the renaming of elements, addition/modification of comments, and rearrangemet of variables.
